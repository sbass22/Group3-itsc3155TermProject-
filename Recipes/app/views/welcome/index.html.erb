                    Our goal is to create an online community recipe cookbook. 
                    It will allow for members of the community to publicly add 
                    recipes to our cookbook and view recipes from other active
                    "chefs" in our community. Being able to prepare your own meal 
                    is a mark of independence, maturity and financial stability.
                    We also have some of our favorite recipes yet simple for you to benchmark your 
                    abilities in the kitchen.
                    Happy Cooking :)
